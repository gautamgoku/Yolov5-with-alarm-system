Animal Detection at URJA For this purpose, we are incorporating algorithms used
for detection into the surveillance cameras already available in NITK. We are using
You Only Look Once (YOLO v5) which we have trained to detect dogs in NITK.

Output
In this project we have a surveillance system to monitor the movements of animals
around URJA and have developed an alarm system to flee the nearby animals(dog)
from the URJA Station. We have implemented YOLO method for detection of objects
because it achieves faster results beating other real-time object detection algorithms
by a large margin. Also we have done literature reviews to better understand the
camera placement. We have gathered video samples of the URJA surveillance and
used it for the detection purpose..
